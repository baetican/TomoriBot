/**
 * Locks in /tool's and /generate's registration restrictions across the command modernization.
 *
 * Both roots are members of neither GUILD_ONLY_CATEGORIES nor MANAGER_ONLY_CATEGORIES
 * (commandLoader.ts), so both are DM-capable and unrestricted today. `/generate` now owns both
 * direct prompt image generation and the contextual Auto image flow alongside `/generate scene`;
 * those capabilities are meant to remain available in DMs. A move that silently added a context
 * or permission default to either root would take DM support away from the members already there,
 * and nothing in check, lint, or check-locales would notice.
 *
 * The members each root keeps are asserted elsewhere: /tool's by configRegistration.test.ts's
 * RETAINED_KEYS_BY_ROOT, /generate's by dissolvedBotRegistration.test.ts.
