Which kind of interaction a command should be, before anything is built. Every TomoriBot command follows
one of eight archetypes, and each has a reference command to copy. Wiring is in
[Adding a Panel](/contributing/extending/panel/); text and layout are in
[Panel Prose and Layout](/contributing/policies/panel-prose-and-layout/).

## Choose an archetype

| Archetype | Use when | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Categorized Control Panel | A root owns several related settings areas that users revisit and compare | `/moderation`; also `/config`, `/personal config`, `/memories`, `/personal memories` |
| Collection Panel | The pages are saved entities the user created, plus a way to add one | `/providers`, `/personal providers`; inside `/config`, the MCP servers and SillyTavern presets pages |
| Entity Workspace | The user needs two axes at once: which entity, and which aspect of it | `/config` Persona category (persona selector plus nine pages) |
| Paginated Reference | Read-only information users browse repeatedly, rebuilt from definitions or stored data | `/help`, `/status`, `/stats` |
| Guided Wizard | Ordered choices, later steps depend on earlier ones, nothing is saved until the end | `/setup` |
| Direct Command Family | The user knows the operation, and slash options can name the target safely | `/impersonate`; also `/persona`, `/generate`, `/export`, `/import`, `/tool` |
| Immediate Action | Running the command is the whole intent, with no state worth showing | `/respond`, `/kill`, `/compact`, `/ping`, `/punish`, `/reward` |
| Destructive Action | The operation deletes broad state, removes something irreversibly, or replaces configuration in bulk | `/reset config`; in panels, the `remove-prompt` / `remove-confirm` / `remove-cancel` routes |

The three panel archetypes share one system (catalog, builder, routes). They differ only in how the
active page is chosen: by category, by saved entity, or by entity plus page.

### When not to make a panel

- Two or three self-explanatory operations, such as `/matrix link` and `/matrix unlink`.
- Generation with clear parameters that runs once.
- A one-off diagnostic or link.
- Lifecycle commands whose purpose is creating, importing, or removing an entity (`/persona create`).
- A destructive action whose safety comes from confirmation. Browsing adds nothing to it.

Do not add a panel only to remove one slash path.

## Panel rules

These apply to all three panel archetypes.

- **Navigation never writes.** Category buttons, page selects, and entity selects only change what is
  shown. A select's default marks the current page. Writes happen through an explicit button or a modal
  submission, and end with a receipt and refreshed state.
- **Categories:** at most five top-row buttons, the active one `Primary`. More areas than that belong
  in a page select within a category.
- **Rebuild state on every click.** Reload from the database and resolve stable IDs within the current
  scope. Trust nothing from the old message: names, list positions, select defaults. When a selected
  entity has been removed, fall back to a fixed choice (the main persona, the neighbouring entry, or
  the add page) and say so.
- **Reads can fail.** Distinguish an empty collection from a failed read. A stale read may still show
  saved values with a warning, a `Retry` button, and writes disabled; a failed read with nothing to
  show is a retryable failure and must never render as empty.
- **Receipts:** after a write, repaint the saved state with a receipt. A no-op submit gets an `info`
  receipt. A failed write keeps the previous state on screen and never shows the attempted change.

### Collection Panels

- The entity select lists saved entities with stable database IDs as option values and localized
  names as labels. The add action is its first option.
- Selecting an entity opens its page. Activating, enabling, or removing it takes a separate button.
- Past 25 entities, page the select (`resolveRangeSelection()` and `buildRangeSelectOptions()`); never
  truncate or merge labels.
- A panel that serves two ownership scopes with one builder names the scope in its title, as
  `/providers` (`Server Providers`) and `/personal providers` (`Personal Providers`) do.

### Entity Workspaces

- Switching page keeps the entity; switching entity keeps the page.
- The main persona is the first selection and is labelled as the main persona.

### Recorded exception

The SillyTavern presets select activates the chosen preset directly, and `None` disables presets. Only
one preset can be active and another selection reverses it, so a preview step would add a click to the
select's only purpose. The select is disabled on a stale read, re-authorizes before writing, and still
repaints with a receipt; deleting a preset keeps the normal button and confirmation.

Other departures need a verified Discord limit, a different archetype, or a recorded product decision,
added here.

## Destructive actions

Confirmation scales with the damage: removing one recoverable entry needs less than resetting a server.

1. Resolve the exact target and authorize the actor.
2. Show localized impact text naming the target and what is lost.
3. Require an explicit confirm button. Resets of a whole workspace also need a high-friction check.
4. Re-resolve the target and re-authorize after confirmation.
5. Run the repository operation once; repeated or stale clicks must not run it again.
6. Invalidate caches only after success.
7. Show a receipt naming what was removed and whether an export can restore it.

Selecting a page, selecting an entity, or a pre-checked checkbox is never consent to destroy. After a
removal, drop the removed ID from the panel state, reload the collection, and select a fixed neighbour
or the add page.

`/nuke` still confirms through a required yes/no slash option; moving it to a button confirmation is
open work.

## Guided wizards

- Keep a typed draft that holds only this invocation's choices. `/setup` keeps drafts in memory
  (`setupDraftStore.ts`), where a restart discards them; use a durable draft only when resuming across
  restarts is a product requirement.
- Route every control through the global registry, with no collectors. The only expiry is the draft's
  own lifetime, checked on each click.
- Cancel never saves anything, and a repeated submission cannot create or charge twice.
- Switching between mutually exclusive modes replaces the draft and discards the old mode's
  credential.
- Secrets never appear in review text, logs, custom IDs, or errors.
- The final receipt repaints the wizard's own message and has no controls.

## Direct commands and immediate actions

- Use native slash options for users, channels, roles, attachments, booleans, numbers, and short
  choice lists. Use autocomplete for database entities, returning stable IDs, and validate the
  submitted value again: a suggestion does not authorize anything.
- Open a modal only for input too long or too structured for slash options.
- Check context and permissions quickly, then defer before any database, provider, or history work.
- Add confirmation only where the consequence calls for it.
- When a command is renamed, keep the established verb (`/kill` over `stop`) and mention the old
  wording in the description and `/help`.

## Visibility and authorization

| Mode | Level | Mechanism | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Hide from discovery | Command | `guildOnly` or `managerOnly` exported by the command module, applied by `applyRootCommandRestrictions()` in `src/utils/discord/commandLoader.ts` | The whole root is ineligible for the same actors |
| 2. Deny on execution | Command | A check in `execute()` with a localized denial | Mixed roots, and always underneath mode 1 |
| 3. Deny on interaction | Panel | Re-resolve and re-authorize in the route handler | Every button, select, and modal submission |
| 4. Filter or disable | Panel | Leave the control out, or render it disabled | See below |

Modes 2 and 3 are always on. `setContexts(Guild)` is a platform guarantee, so a guild-only command may
assume a guild. `setDefaultMemberPermissions(ManageGuild)` is only a default that server admins can
override per role and channel, so a handler never treats being called as permission.

- **Disabled or omitted**: disable a control for a temporary state or an unmet prerequisite (Add at the
limit, writes during a stale read), or to show a member which manager-only actions exist. Omit it when
it cannot apply in this context, when its existence or state is sensitive, or when the component
cannot be disabled (a single select option). `/config` is registered without a Manage Server default
so members can reach the Persona category, and manager-only actions appear there disabled.

## Done means

- Every operation the panel absorbed has a place in it, and every current value and override can be
  found.
- Writes use the existing validation and repository path and invalidate the same caches.
- Destructive actions follow the section above, and disabled-versus-omitted is applied the same way
  throughout.
- Stale selections and changed permissions are safe.
- Behaviour past 25 entities is tested.
- Every locale covers navigation, actions, receipts, and denials.
