title: "Code Comment Policy"
sidebar:
  order: 40
---

A comment carries a fact the code cannot state. Before writing one, name the criterion that
justifies it. If none fits, write no comment and improve the name, type, or function boundary
instead.

## Keep criteria

- **a.** External behavior of Discord, an LLM provider, a protocol, or a library.
- **b.** A security, privacy, or redaction reason.
- **c.** A cache, ordering, transaction, or acknowledgement invariant, including anything that must
  happen before slow work.
- **d.** The meaning of a magic number, sentinel, opaque constant, or dense pattern.
- **e.** A measured performance tradeoff.
- **f.** Why a lint or type suppression cannot be removed.
- **g.** A constraint someone could break while simplifying the code.
- **h.** A constraint learned from production or debugging. Write only the constraint; the story of
  finding it belongs in the commit message.

```ts
// Discord rejects a second acknowledgement, so modal branches return before deferral.
if (opensModal) return showModal();
```

When writing new code and unsure, leave the comment out. When cleaning up existing comments and
unsure, keep it: a wrong deletion can erase the only record of a constraint. A comment that
restates the next line and also carries a keep fact is a keep.

## Never write

- The next statement in English: `// Parse and validate composite-key format` above
  `parseCompositeKey(...)`.
- A restated function, type, variable, or parameter name.
- Step numbers (`// 1. Parse the value`, `// 5c-2. Build the menu`) or `// Rule 3:` scaffolding.
  Numbered JSDoc lists are allowed only when the order is part of an exported contract.
- Section banners or dividers; extract a named function instead.
- Commented-out code.
- What the code used to do, a line number, or an old phase or task label.
- Incident history ("added after last quarter's outage"). Git history holds it.
- Point-in-time measurements ("31k entries", "adds ~40 ms"). They read as current and go stale.
- Commentary about the comment ("Two exclusions are load-bearing", "Important:").
- Justification aimed at a reviewer. That belongs in the PR description.

A comment past two or three lines usually retells how the code came to be, and the constraint
sentence is already in it. Cut to that sentence. Ordering, security, and compatibility rules sometimes need a short
paragraph.

```ts
// Never sweep the client's own member: discord.js resolves permissions through it.
```

Examples in docs are illustrative. Deployment sizes, record counts, and host details do not belong in
this public repository (see [Docs Authoring](/contributing/localization/docs-authoring/#audience)).

## JSDoc

The signature already states names and types, so a tag that repeats them adds nothing and goes stale.

```ts
/**
 * Extract image URLs from a Brave image search response.
 * @param response - Image search API response   // remove: the type says this
 * @returns Promise<string[]>                    // remove: so does the return type
 */
```

Keep tags that say what the type cannot: units, ranges, valid values, nullability the type does not
encode, failure behavior, ordering and lifecycle, side effects, cancellation, and idempotency.

```ts
/**
 * @param modes - Empty when the provider reports no capabilities
 * @returns Comma-joined list, or empty string when no modes are supported
 * @throws {NvidiaImageModelUnavailableError} When the codename has no registered spec
 */
```

A partial tag list is correct. Never add tags to make a block look complete, and never delete a useful
tag because its neighbours have none. The summary line follows the same rule: `Build system prompt for
LLM` above `buildSystemPrompt()` goes, while "Finds the most active text channel that's accessible to
the bot" above `findBestChannel()` stays, because it defines "best".

## Dashes

Em dashes, en dashes, and spaced double hyphens are not allowed in authored prose: comments, JSDoc,
pages under `docs/`, and user-facing strings in `src/locales/`. Replace each with punctuation that
names the relationship between the two halves:

| Relationship | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Second half explains the first | Colon | `Retirement is process-local: a restart refetches every guild's stickers.` |
| Cause | `, so` or `because` | `Discord rejects a second acknowledgement, so modal branches return early.` |
| Aside | Parentheses | `The probe caches its own failure (until the next restart).` |
| Independent clauses | Period or semicolon | `The webhook send failed. The bot path is the fallback.` |
| Term and definition | Colon | `` `large-v3`: ~4-5 GB VRAM `` |
| Numeric range | Plain hyphen | `1-5 minutes` |

If none fits, the sentence is doing two things; split it. Japanese text uses `：`, `。`, and `（）`.
A dash that is data stays: a CLI flag (`--no-build-isolation`), Discord's `-# ` marker, a URL, or
quoted output from another system.

## The checker

```bash
bun run audit-comments                  # full-tree audit; prints every finding
bun run audit-comments --docs [paths]   # prose audit of Markdown, default docs/en/contributing
bun test ./scripts/checks/commentPolicy.test.ts
```

`scripts/checks/checkCommentPolicy.ts` runs deterministic rules that fail in any mode, and heuristic
rules that warn. `--staged` or `--base <ref>` limits the heuristics to changed lines, where
`obvious-narration` becomes an error. It runs as a non-blocking warning under Documentation in
`bun run vl`, and is not part of the test runner.

| Rule | Kind | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `prose-dash` | Error | Dashes in comments, `docs/` Markdown, and `src/locales/` string literals. Skips code, URLs, link targets, CLI flags, `-# `, and empty table cells |
| `jsdoc-restatement` | Error | A tag that equals its parameter name or type after normalization |
| `numbered-narration` | Error | Step numbers on line comments |
| `rule-scaffolding` | Error | `Rule N:` and `Rule #N` prefixes |
| `obvious-narration` | Warning (error on changed lines) | Summary echoes and action-verb narration |
| `orphaned-comment` | Error | Cleanup damage: a continuation with no opening line, a bare divider, an empty JSDoc block |
| `duplicate-comment` | Audit warning | Blocks with the same text after normalizing markers, whitespace, and case. Floor: 12 words and 60 characters |
| `long-comment-block` | Audit warning | A non-JSDoc block of 11 lines or more outside `tests/` |

A locale tree counts as one identity for `duplicate-comment`, so an English comment copied into every
translated tree reports once. Suppression comments are skipped because each one is a separate lint
decision. The standing `long-comment-block` finding is the pricing table in
`src/db/seed/catalog/models.ts`, where the length is the data.

`COMMENT_AUDIT_DUPLICATE_MIN_WORDS`, `COMMENT_AUDIT_DUPLICATE_MIN_CHARS`, and
`COMMENT_AUDIT_LONG_BLOCK_LINES` override the limits for recalibration only. The bot never reads them,
and a value that is not a whole positive number falls back to the default. The limits were chosen so
that the full report stays readable in one sitting. When it stops being readable, re-measure; never
delete rationale to shrink the count.

## Working through findings

Treat a finding as a prompt to review. For each one, read the whole block and
the code it describes. Remove it only when the code already says everything in it; otherwise rewrite
it down to the constraint. Then re-read the surrounding lines for orphaned continuations and empty
JSDoc, and review the diff as prose. Clear most duplicate groups by extracting the code path the
copies share; deleting the copies loses the rationale.

## Exceptions

`scripts/checks/comment-policy-exceptions.json` records current, intentional matches only, such as
literal syntax that resembles a violation, each with the exact comment and a reason. The checker
reports an exception as stale once its comment is gone. It is not a log of past cleanups.
