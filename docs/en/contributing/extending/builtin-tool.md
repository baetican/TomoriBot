How to add a tool the model can call during the tool loop. `toolInitializer.ts` discovers it at
startup, so there is no registration step.

## Steps

1. Create a file in `src/tools/functionCalls/` exporting a class that extends `BaseTool`.
2. Define `name` (unique across all tools), `description` (shown to the model, in English),
   `category`, `parameters` (JSON Schema), and `execute()`.
3. Add optional members as needed: `requiresFeatureFlag` (see
   [Adding a Feature-Flagged Tool](/contributing/extending/feature-flag-tool/)), `requiresPermissions`,
   and `requiresFollowUp` when the result needs another generation turn.
4. Pass `context.abortSignal` to every HTTP call: `signal` for `fetch`, `externalSignal` for
   `safeDownload`, and any helper option that takes an `AbortSignal`. Otherwise `/kill` stops the turn
   but the request keeps running.
5. If the tool posts its own output (an attachment, a webhook message), check
   `context.abortSignal?.aborted` immediately before posting and return a failure instead. `/kill` stops
   the tool loop from awaiting the tool. The tool can keep running when a backend ignores the signal,
   so without this check a killed tool can still post. If it generates billable media, also add its name
   to the matching image, video, or voice group in `src/utils/tools/deliberateToolMode.ts`; those groups
   feed `MEDIA_GENERATION_TOOL_NAMES`, which is how `/kill` knows to warn about the leftover job.

## Verify

Run `bun run check` and `bun run lint`, then prompt the bot so it calls the tool and check the
tool-loop logs. How tools are dispatched: [Tool loop](/architecture/pipelines/tool-loop/).
